  * Backwards-incompatible change: When multiple requests are
    queued up on a checkout, if one of the requests throws an
    error all the pending requests are removed from the queue.
    This makes a non-nested sequence of method-calls on a
    checkout less dangerous and more like the synchronous code
    it is mimicing.
  * Removed vestigal parts of an undocumented feature that was
    broken several releases ago: In non-void context, methods
    on a checkout used to return a guard that when destroyed
    would cancel the remote method call. Instead, now you should
    use the throw_fatal_error method on the checkout. The checkout
    will then be in an undefined state and should be discarded.

  * Backwards-incompatible change: The behaviour enabled by the
    undocumented client option added in the previous release,
    refork_after_error, is now the default behaviour. Instead
    there is a new option called dont_refork_after_error to get
    back the original behaviour.
  * If log_defer_object is passed in when creating a checkout,
    operations on this checkout are recorded as Log::Defer
    timer events
  * Major documentation updates, including working SYNOPSIS
